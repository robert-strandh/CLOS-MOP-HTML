  <H3>Implementation and User Specialization</H3>

<p>
The purpose of the Metaobject Protocol is to provide users with a
powerful mechanism for extending and customizing the basic behavior of
the Common Lisp Object System.  As an object-oriented description of
the basic CLOS behavior, the Metaobject Protocol makes it possible to
create these extensions by defining specialized subclasses of existing
metaobject classes.
</p>

<p>
The Metaobject Protocol provides this capability without interfering
with the implementor's ability to develop high-performance
implementations.  This balance between user extensibility and
implementor freedom is mediated by placing explicit restrictions on
each.  Some of these restrictions are general---they apply to the
entire class graph and the applicability of all methods.  These are
presented in this section.
</p>

<p>
The following additional terminology is used to present these
restrictions:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Metaobjects are divided into three categories.  Those defined
in this document are called <I>specified</I>; those defined by an
implementation but not mentioned in this document are called
<I>implementation-specific</I>; and those defined by a portable
program are called <I>portable</I>.

<li> A class <I>I</I> is <I>interposed</I> between two other classes
<I>C<sub>1</sub></I> and <I>C<sub>2</sub></I> if and only if there is
some path, following direct superclasses, from the
class <I>C<sub>1</sub></I> to the class <I>C<sub>2</sub></I> which
includes <I>I</I>. </li>

<li> A method is <I>specialized</I> for a class if and only if
  <UL>
    <LI> that class is in the list of specializers associated with the
      method; and
    </LI>
    <LI> the method is in the list of methods associated with some
      generic function.
    </LI>
  </UL>

<li> In a given implementation, a specified method is said to have been
<I>promoted</I> if and only if the specializers of the method, 
<I>S<sub>1</sub></I> ... <I>S<sub>n</sub></I>
are defined in this specification as the classes 
<I>C<sub>1</sub></I> ... <I>C<sub>n</sub></I>, but in the
implementation, one or more of the specializers <I>S<sub>i</sub></I>,
is a superclass of the class given in the
specification <I>C<sub>i</sub></I>.

<li> For a given generic function and set of  arguments, a method <I>M<sub>2</sub></I>
<I>extends</I> a method <I>M<sub>1</sub></I> if and only if:</li>

<ol type="i">
<li><I>M<sub>1</sub></I> and <I>M<sub>2</sub></I>
are both associated with the given generic
function,</li>

<li><I>M<sub>1</sub></I> and <I>M<sub>2</sub></I> are both applicable
to the given arguments,</li>

<li>the specializers and qualifiers of the methods are such that when
the generic function is called, <I>M<sub>2</sub></I> is executed before <I>M<sub>1</sub></I>,</li>

<li><I>M<sub>1</sub></I> will be executed if and only if <B>call-next-method</B>
is invoked from within the body of <I>M<sub>2</sub></I> and</li>

<li><B>call-next-method</B> is invoked from within the body of <I>M<sub>2</sub></I>,
thereby causing <I>M<sub>1</sub></I> to be executed.</li>
</ol>

<li> For a given generic function and set of arguments, a method <I>M<sub>2</sub></I>
<I>overrides</I> a method <I>M<sub>1</sub></I> if and only if conditions i through iv
above hold and</li>

<ul>
<li><B>call-next-method</B> is not invoked from within the body
of <I>M<sub>2</sub></I>, thereby preventing <I>M<sub>1</sub></I> from
being executed.</li>
</ul>
