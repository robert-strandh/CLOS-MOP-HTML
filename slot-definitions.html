    <H3>Slot definitions</H3>

    <P>
      A <I>slot definition metaobject</I> contains information about
      the definition of a slot.  There are two kinds of slot
      definition metaobjects.  A direct slot definition metaobject is
      used to represent the direct definition of a slot in a class.
      This corresponds roughly to the slot specifiers found in
      <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_defcla.htm#defclass">defclass</a>
      forms.  An effective slot definition metaobject is used to
      represent information, including inherited information,
      about a slot which is accessible in instances of a
      particular class.
    </P>

    <P>
      Associated with each class metaobject is a list of direct slot
      definition metaobjects representing the slots defined directly
      in the class.  Also associated with each class metaobject is a
      list of effective slot definition metaobjects representing the
      set of slots accessible in instances of that class.
    </P>

    <P>
      The following information is associated with both direct and
      effective slot definitions metaobjects:
    </P>

    <UL>

      <LI><P>The name, allocation, and type are available as forms that
	  could appear in a
	  <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_defcla.htm#defclass">defclass</a>
	  form.</P></LI>
      
      <LI><P>The initialization form, if there is one, is available as
	  a form that could appear in a 
	  <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_defcla.htm#defclass">defclass</a>
	  form.  The initialization form together with its lexical
	  environment is available as a function of no arguments
	  which, when called, returns the result of evaluating the
	  initialization form in its lexical environment. This is
	  called the <I>initfunction</I> of the slot.</P></LI>

      <LI><P>The slot filling initialization arguments are available
	  as a list of symbols.</P></LI>

      <LI><P>The documentation is available as a string
      or <TT>nil</TT>.</P></LI>

    </UL>

    <P>
      Certain other information is only associated with direct slot
      definition metaobjects.  This information applies only to the
      direct definition of the slot in the class (it is not
      inherited).
    </P>

    <UL>

      <LI><P>The function names of those generic functions for which
	  there are automatically generated reader and writer methods.
	  This information is available as lists of function names.
	  Any accessors specified in the 
	  <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_defcla.htm#defclass">defclass</a>
	  form are broken down into their equivalent readers and
	  writers in the direct slot definition.</P></LI>

    </UL>

    <P>
      Information, including inherited information, which applies to
      the definition of a slot in a particular class in which it is
      accessible is associated only with effective slot definition
      metaobjects.
    </P>

    <UL>

      <LI><P>For certain slots, the location of the slot in instances
	  of the class is available.</P></LI>
