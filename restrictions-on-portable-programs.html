    <H4>Restrictions on portable programs</H4>

    <P>
      Portable programs are allowed to define subclasses of specified
      classes, and are permitted to define methods on specified
      generic functions, with the following restrictions.  The results
      are undefined if any of these restrictions is violated.
    </P>

    <UL>

      <LI>
	<P>
	  Portable programs must not redefine any specified classes,
	  generic functions, methods or method combinations.  Any
	  method defined by a portable program on a specified generic
	  function must have at least one specializer that is neither
	  a specified class nor an <TT>eql</TT> specializer whose
	  associated value is an instance of a specified class.
	</P>
      </LI>

      <LI>
	<P>
	  Portable programs may define methods that extend specified
	  methods unless the description of the specified method
	  explicitly prohibits this.  Unless there is a specific
	  statement to the contrary, these extending methods must
	  return whatever value was returned by the call to
	  <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_call_n.htm#call-next-method">
	    call-next-method</a>.
	</P>
      </LI>

      <LI>
	<P>
	  Portable programs may define methods that override specified
	  methods only when the description of the specified method
	  explicitly allows this.  Typically, when a method is allowed
	  to be overridden, a small number of related methods will
	  need to be overridden as well.
	</P>
	
	<P>
	  An example of this is the specified methods on the generic
	  functions
	  <a href="add-dependent.html">add-dependent</a>,
	  <a href="remove-dependent.html">remove-dependent</a>, and
	  <a href="map-dependents.html">map-dependents</a>.
	  Overriding a specified method on one
	  of these generic functions requires that the corresponding
	  method on the other two generic functions be overridden as
	  well.
	</P>
      </LI>
      
      <LI>
	<P>
	  Portable methods on specified generic functions specialized
	  to portable metaobject classes must be defined before any
	  instances of those classes (or any subclasses) are created,
	  either directly or indirectly by a call to
	  <a href="make-instance.html">make-instance</a>.
	  Methods can be defined after instances are
	  created by
	  <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_alloca.htm#allocate-instance">allocate-instance</a> however.  Portable
	  metaobject classes cannot be redefined.
	</P>
	
	<P><B>Implementation note:</B></P>
	
	<P>
	  The purpose of this last restriction is to permit
	  implementations to provide performance optimizations by
	  analyzing, at the time the first instance of a metaobject
	  class is initialized, what portable methods will be
	  applicable to it.  This can make it possible to optimize
	  calls to those specified generic functions which would have
	  no applicable portable methods.
	</P>
	
	<P><B>Note:</B></P>
	
	<P>
	  The specification technology used in this document needs
	  further development.  The concepts of object-oriented
	  protocols and subclass specialization are intuitively
	  familiar to programmers of object-oriented systems; the
	  protocols presented here fit quite naturally into this
	  framework.  Nonetheless, in preparing this document, we have
	  found it difficult to give specification-quality
	  descriptions of the protocols in a way that makes it clear
	  what extensions users can and cannot write.  Object-oriented
	  protocol specification is inherently about specifying
	  leeway, and this seems difficult using current technology.
