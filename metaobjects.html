    <H2>Metaobjects</H2>

    <P>
      For each kind of program element there is a corresponding
      <I>basic metaobject class</I>.  These are the classes: 
      <a href="class-class.html">class</a>,
      <a href="class-slot-definition.html">slot-definition</a>, 
      <a href="class-generic-function.html">generic-function</a>,
      <a href="class-method.html">method</a>, and
      <a href="class-method-combination.html">
	method-combination</a>.  A <I>metaobject class</I> is a
      subclass of exactly one of these classes.  The results are
      undefined if an attempt is made to define a class that is a
      subclass of more than one basic metaobject class.  A
      <I>metaobject</I> is an instance of a metaobject class.
    </P>

    <P>
      Each metaobject represents one program element.  Associated with
      each metaobject is the information required to serve its role.
      This includes information that might be provided directly in a
      user interface macro such as
      <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_defcla.htm#defclass">defclass</a>
      or
      <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_defcla.htm#defmethod">defmethod</a>.
      It also includes information computed indirectly from other
      metaobjects such as that computed from class inheritance or the
      full set of methods associated with a generic function.
    </P>

    <P>
      Much of the information associated with a metaobject is in the
      form of connections to other metaobjects.  This interconnection
      means that the role of a metaobject is always based on that of
      other metaobjects.  As an introduction to this interconnected
      structure, this section presents a partial enumeration of the
      kinds of information associated with each kind of metaobject.
      More detailed information is presented later.
