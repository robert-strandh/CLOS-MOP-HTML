<P><B>compute-applicable-methods-using-classes</B>
<I>generic-function</I> <I>classes</I> =&gt; <I>methods</I>, <I>ok</I></P>

<P><B>Arguments and values:</B></P>

<P><I>generic-function</I> -- A generic function metaobject.</P>

<P><I>classes</I> -- A list of class metaobjects.</P>

<P><I>methods</I> -- A (possibly empty) list of method metaobjects.</P>

<P><I>ok</I> -- A generalized boolean.

<P><B>Description:</B></P>

<p>
This generic function is called to attempt to determine the method
applicability of a generic function given only the classes of the required
arguments.
</p>

<p>
If it is possible to completely determine the ordered list of
applicable methods based only on the supplied classes, this generic
function returns that list as its first value and true as its second
value.  The returned list of method metaobjects is sorted by
precedence order, the most specific method coming first.  If no
methods are applicable to arguments with the specified classes, the
empty list and true are returned.
</p>

<p>
If it is not possible to completely determine the ordered list of
applicable methods based only on the supplied classes, this generic
function returns an unspecified first value and false as its second
value.
</p>

<p>
When a generic function is invoked, the discriminating function must
determine the ordered list of methods applicable to the arguments.
Depending on the generic function and the arguments, this is done in
one of three ways: using a memoized value; calling 
<B>compute-applicable-methods-using-classes</B> or calling
<a href="compute-applicable-methods.html">
  compute-applicable-methods</a>.
(Refer to the description of
<a href="compute-discriminating-function.html">
  compute-discriminating-function</a> for the details of this
  process.)
</p>

<p>
The following consistency relationship between
<B>compute-applicable-methods-using-classes</B> and
<a href="compute-applicable-methods.html">
  compute-applicable-methods</a> must be maintained: for any given
generic function and set of arguments, if
<B>compute-applicable-methods-using-classes</B> returns a second value of
true, the first value must be equal to the value that would be
returned by a corresponding call to
<a href="compute-applicable-methods.html">
  compute-applicable-methods</a>.  The results are undefined if a
portable method on either of these generic functions causes this
consistency to be violated.
</p>

<p>
The list returned by this generic function will not be mutated by the
implementation.  The results are undefined if a portable program
mutates the list returned by this generic function.
</p>

  <tr>
    <td><a href="compute-applicable-methods-using-classes-standard-generic-function.html">

	<I>arguments</I></a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<P><B>Remarks:</B></P>

<p>
This generic function exists to allow user extensions which alter
method lookup rules, but which base the new rules only on the classes
of the required arguments, to take advantage of the class-based method
lookup memoization found in many implementations.  (There is of course
no requirement for an implementation to provide this optimization.)
</p>

<p>
Such an extension can be implemented by two methods, one on this
generic function and one on 
<a href="compute-applicable-methods.html">compute-applicable-methods</a>.
Whenever the user extension is in effect, the first method will return
a second value of true.  This should allow the implementation to
absorb these cases into its own memoization scheme.
</p>

<p>
To get appropriate performance, other kinds of extensions may require methods
on
<a href="compute-discriminating-function.html">
  compute-discriminating-function</a> which implement their own
memoization scheme.
