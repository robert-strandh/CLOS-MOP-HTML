    <H3>Processing method bodies</H3>

    <P>
      Before a method can be created, the list of forms comprising the
      method body must be converted to a method function.  This
      conversion is a two step process.
    <P>

    <P><B>Note:</B></P>
    <P>
      The body of methods can also appear in
      the <TT>:initial-methods</TT> option of
      <a href="the-defgeneric-macro.html">defgeneric</a> forms.
      Initial methods are not considered by any of the protocols
      specified in this document.
    </P>

    <P>
      The first step occurs during macro-expansion of the macro form.
      In this step, the method lambda list, declarations and body are
      converted to a lambda expression called a <I>method lambda</I>.
      This conversion is based on information associated with the
      generic function definition in effect at the time the macro form
      is expanded.
    </P>

    <P>
      The generic function definition is obtained by calling
      <a href="ensure-generic-function.html">ensure-generic-function</a>
      with a first argument of the generic function name specified in
      the macro form.  The <TT>:lambda-list</TT> keyword argument is
      not passed in this call.
    </P>

    <P>
      Given the generic function, production of the method lambda
      proceeds by calling
      <a href="make-method-lambda.html">make-method-lambda</a>.  The
      first argument in this call is the generic function obtained as
      described above.  The second argument is the result of calling
      <a href="class-prototype.html">class-prototype</a> on the result
      of calling
      <a href="generic-function-method-class.html">
	generic-function-method-class</a>
      on the generic
      function.  The third argument is a lambda expression formed from
      the method lambda list, declarations and body.  The fourth
      argument is the macro-expansion environment of the macro form;
      this is the value of the <TT>&amp;environment</Tt> argument to
      the
      <a href="the-defmethod-macro.html">defmethod</a>
      macro.
    </P>

    <P>
      The generic function
      <a href="make-method-lambda.html">make-method-lambda</a>
      returns two
      values.  The first is the method lambda itself.  The second is a
      list of initialization arguments and values.  These are included
      in the initialization arguments when the method is created.
    </P>

    <P>
      In the second step, the method lambda is converted to a function
      which properly captures the lexical scope of the macro form.
      This is done by having the method lambda appear in the
      macro-expansion as the argument of the
      <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/s_fn.htm">
	function</a> special
      form.  During the subsequent evaluation of the macro-expansion,
      the result of the
      <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/s_fn.htm">
	function</a> special form is the methodfunction.
    </P>
