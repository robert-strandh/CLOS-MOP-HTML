<H1>Initialization of Class Metaobjects</H1>

<P>
A class metaobject can be created by calling 
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_mk_ins.htm#make-instance">
  make-instance</a>.  The
initialization arguments establish the definition of the class.  A class
metaobject can be redefined by calling 
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_reinit.htm#reinitialize-instance">
reinitialize-instance</a>.  Some
classes of class metaobject do not support redefinition; in these cases,
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_reinit.htm#reinitialize-instance">
reinitialize-instance</a> signals an error.
</P>

<P>
Initialization of a class metaobject must be done by calling
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_mk_ins.htm#make-instance">
  make-instance</a>
and allowing it to call
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_init_i.htm#initialize-instance">initialize-instance</a>.
Reinitialization of a class metaobject must be done by calling
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_reinit.htm#reinitialize-instance">
reinitialize-instance</a>.  Portable programs must not call
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_init_i.htm#initialize-instance">initialize-instance</a>
directly to initialize a class metaobject. Portable
programs must not call
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_shared.htm#shared-initialize">shared-initialize</a>
directly to initialize or
reinitialize a class metaobject.  Portable programs must not call
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_chg_cl.htm#change-class">
change-class</a>
to change the class of any class metaobject or to turn a
non-class object into a class metaobject.
</P>

<P>
Since metaobject classes may not be redefined, no behavior is specified for
the result of calls to
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_upda_1.htm#update-instance-for-redefined-class">update-instance-for-redefined-class</a>
on class
metaobjects.  Since the class of class metaobjects may not be changed, no
behavior is specified for the result of calls to
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_update.htm#update-instance-for-different-class">update-instance-for-different-class</a>
on class metaobjects.
</P>

<P>
During initialization or reinitialization, each initialization
argument is checked for errors and then associated with the class
metaobject.  The value can then be accessed by calling the appropriate
accessor as shown in the table below. (FIXME:insert anchor)
</P>

<P>
This section begins with a description of the error checking and
processing of each initialization argument.  This is followed by a
table showing the generic functions that can be used to access the
stored initialization arguments.  Initialization behavior specific to
the different specified class metaobject classes comes next.  The
section ends with a set of restrictions on portable methods affecting
class metaobject initialization and reinitialization.
</P>

<P>
In these descriptions, the phrase ``this argument defaults to <I>value</I>''
means that when that initialization argument is not supplied, initialization
or reinitialization is performed as if <I>value</I> had been supplied.  For
some initialization arguments this could be done by the use of default
initialization arguments, but whether it is done this way is not specified.
Implementations are free to define default initialization arguments for
specified class metaobject classes.  Portable programs are free to define
default initialization arguments for portable subclasses of the class 
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/t_class.htm#class">class</a>.
</P>

<P>
Unless there is a specific note to the contrary, then during reinitialization,
if an initialization argument is not supplied, the previously stored value is
left unchanged.
</P>

<UL>
<LI><P>The <TT>:direct-default-initargs</TT> argument is a list of
canonicalized default initialization arguments.</P>

<P>An error is signaled if this value is not a proper list, or if any
element of the list is not a canonicalized default initialization
argument.</P>

<P>If the class metaobject is being initialized, this argument
defaults to the empty list.</P>
</LI>

<LI><P>The <TT>:direct-slots</TT> argument is a list of canonicalized
slot specifications.</P>

<P>An error is signaled if this value is not a proper list or if any
element of the list is not a canonicalized slot specification.</P>

<P>
After error checking, this value is converted to a list of direct slot
definition metaobjects before it is associated with the class metaobject.
Conversion of each canonicalized slot specification to a direct slot
definition metaobject is a two-step process.  First, the generic function
<a href="direct-slot-definition-class.html">direct-slot-definition-class</a>
is called with the class metaobject and the 
canonicalized slot specification to determine the class of the new direct slot
definition metaobject; this permits both the class metaobject and the
canonicalized slot specification to control the resulting direct slot
definition metaobject class.  Second, 
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_mk_ins.htm#make-instance">
  make-instance</a>
is applied to the
direct slot definition metaobject class and the canonicalized slot
specification.  This conversion could be implemented as shown in the following
code:</P>

<PRE>
(defun convert-to-direct-slot-definition (class canonicalized-slot)
  (apply #'make-instance
         (apply #'direct-slot-definition-class
                class canonicalized-slot)
         canonicalized-slot))
</PRE>

<P>If the class metaobject is being initialized, this argument defaults to the
empty list.</P>

<P>Once the direct slot definition metaobjects have been created, the specified
reader and writer methods are created.  The generic functions
<a href="reader-method-class.html">reader-method-class</a> and <a href="writer-method-class.html">writer-method-class</a> are called to determine the
classes of the method metaobjects created.</P>
</LI>

<LI><P>The <TT>:direct-superclasses</TT> argument is a list of class
metaobjects.  Classes which do not support multiple inheritance signal
an error if the list contains more than one element.</P>

<P>An error is signaled if this value is not a proper list or if
<a href="validate-superclass.html">validate-superclass</a> applied to
<I>class</I> and any element of this list returns false.</P>

<P>When the class metaobject is being initialized, and this argument is either
not supplied or is the empty list, this argument defaults as follows:  if the
class is an instance of 
<a href="class-standard-class.html">standard-class</a> or one of its subclasses the
default value is a list of the class 
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/t_std_ob.htm#standard-object">standard-object</a>; if the class is an
instance of <a href="class-funcallable-standard-class.html">funcallable-standard-class</a> or one of its subclasses the
default value is list of the class
<a href="class-funcallable-standard-object.html">funcallable-standard-object</a>.</P>

<P>After any defaulting of the value, the generic function
<a href="add-direct-subclass.html">add-direct-subclass</a> is called
once for each element of the list.</P>

<P>When the class metaobject is being reinitialized and this argument
is supplied, the generic
function <a href="remove-direct-subclass.html">
remove-direct-subclass</a> is called once for each class metaobject in
the previously stored value but not in the new value; the generic
function <a href="add-direct-subclass.html">add-direct-subclass</a>
is called once for each class
metaobject in the new value but not in the previously stored
value.</P>
</LI>

<LI><P>The <TT>:documentation</TT> argument is a string or <TT>nil</TT>.</P>

<P>An error is signaled if this value is not a string or <TT>nil</TT>.</P>

<P>If the class metaobject is being initialized, this argument defaults
to <TT>nil</TT>.</P>
</LI>

<LI><P>The <TT>ame</TT> argument is an object.</P>

<P>If the class is being initialized, this argument defaults
  to <TT>nil</TT>.</P> 
</LI>
</UL>

<P>After the processing and defaulting of initialization arguments described
above, the value of each initialization argument is associated with the class
metaobject.  These values can then be accessed by calling the corresponding
generic function.  The correspondences are as follows:</P>

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Initialization Argument</th>
    <th>Generic Function</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><B>:direct-default-initargs</B></td>

Initialization arguments and accessors for class metaobjects.
</P>

<P>
Instances of the class
<a href="class-standard-class.html">standard-class</a>
support multiple inheritance and reinitialization.  Instances of the
class <a href="class-funcallable-standard-class.html">funcallable-standard-class</a> support multiple inheritance
and reinitialization.  For forward referenced classes, all of the
initialization arguments default to <TT>nil</TT>.
</P>

<P>
Since built-in classes cannot be created or reinitialized by the user, an
error is signaled if
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_init_i.htm#initialize-instance">initialize-instance</a>
or
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_reinit.htm#reinitialize-instance">
reinitialize-instance</a>
are called to initialize or reinitialize a derived instance of the
class
<a href="class-built-in-class.html">built-in-class</a>.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>

<P>
It is not specified which methods provide the initialization and
reinitialization behavior described above.  Instead, the information needed to
allow portable programs to specialize this behavior is presented as a set of
restrictions on the methods a portable program can define.  The model is that
portable initialization methods have access to the class metaobject when
either all or none of the specified initialization has taken effect.
</P>

<P>
These restrictions govern the methods that a portable program can define
on the generic functions
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_init_i.htm#initialize-instance">initialize-instance</a>,
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_reinit.htm#reinitialize-instance">
reinitialize-instance</a>, and
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_shared.htm#shared-initialize">shared-initialize</a>.
These restrictions
apply only to methods on these generic functions for which the first
specializer is a subclass of the class 
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/t_class.htm#class">class</a>.  Other portable
methods on these generic functions are not affected by these
restrictions.

<LI><P>Portable before-methods must assume that when they are run, none of the
initialization behavior described above has been completed.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Portable after-methods must assume that when they are run, all of the
