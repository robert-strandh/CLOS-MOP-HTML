    <H3>Dependent maintenance protocol</H3>

    <P>
      It is convenient for portable metaobjects to be able to memoize
      information about other metaobjects, portable or otherwise.
      Because class and generic function metaobjects can be
      reinitialized, and generic function metaobjects can be modified
      by adding and removing methods, a means must be provided to
      update this memoized information.
    </P>

    <P>
      The dependent maintenance protocol supports this by providing a
      way to register an object which should be notified whenever a
      class or generic function is modified.  An object which has been
      registered this way is called a <I>dependent</I> of the class
      or generic function metaobject.  The dependents of class and
      generic function metaobjects are maintained with
      <a href="add-dependent.html">add-dependent</a>
      and
      <a href="remove-dependent.html">remove-dependent</a>.
      The dependents of a
      class or generic function metaobject can be accessed with
      <a href="map-dependents.html">map-dependents</a>.
      Dependents are notified about a modification
      by calling
      <a href="update-dependent.html">update-dependent</a>.
      (See the specification of
      <a href="update-dependent.html">update-dependent</a> for
      detailed description of the circumstances under which it is
      called.)
    </P>

    <P>
      To prevent conflicts between two portable programs, or between
      portable programs and the implementation, portable code must not
      register metaobjects themselves as dependents. Instead, portable
      programs which need to record a metaobject as a dependent,
      should encapsulate that metaobject in some other kind of object,
      and record that object as the dependent.  The results are
      undefined if this restriction is violated.
    </P>

    <P><B>Example:</B></P>
    <P>
      This example shows a general facility for encapsulating
      metaobjects before recording them as dependents.  The facility
      defines a basic kind of encapsulating object: an updater.
      Specializations of the basic class can be defined with
      appropriate special updating behavior.  In this way, information
      about the updating required is associated with each updater
      rather than with the metaobject being updated.
    </P>

    <P>
      Updaters are used to encapsulate any metaobject which requires
      updating when a given class or generic function is modified.
      The function
      <a href="record-updater.html">record-updater</a>
      is called to both create an
      updater and add it to the dependents of the class or generic
      function.  Methods on the generic function
      <a href="update-dependent.html">update-dependent</a>,
      specialized to the specific class of updater do the appropriate
      update work.
    </P>

<PRE>
(defclass updater ()
     ((dependent :initarg :dependent :reader dependent)))

(defun record-updater (class dependee dependent &rest initargs)
  (let ((updater (apply #'make-instance class :dependent dependent
                                              initargs)))
    (add-dependent dependee updater)
    updater))
</PRE>

    <P>
      A <TT>flush-cache-updater</TT> simply flushes the cache of the
      dependent when it is updated.
    </P>

<PRE>
(defclass flush-cache-updater (updater) ())

(defmethod update-dependent (dependee (updater flush-cache-updater)
                             &rest args)
  (declare (ignore args))
  (flush-cache (dependent updater)))
