      A list in which the first element is one of the symbols
      <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_defcla.htm#defclass">defclass</a>,

      syntax for that macro is called a <I>user interface macro
      form</I>.  This document provides an extended specification of the
      <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_defcla.htm#defclass">defclass</a>, <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_defmet.htm#defmethod">defmethod</a> and <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_defgen.htm#defgeneric">defgeneric</a> macros.
    </P>

    <P>
      The user interface macros <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_defcla.htm#defclass">defclass</a>, <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_defgen.htm#defgeneric">defgeneric</a> and
      <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_defmet.htm#defmethod">defmethod</a> can be used not only to define metaobjects that
      are instances of the corresponding standard metaobject class,
      but also to define metaobjects that are instances of appropriate
      portable metaobject classes.  To make it possible for portable
      metaobject classes to properly process the information appearing
      in the macro form, this document provides a limited
      specification of the processing of these macro forms.
    </P>

    <P>
      User interface macro forms can be <TT>evaluated</TT> or
      <TT>compiled</TT> and later <TT>executed</TT>.  The effect of
      evaluating or executing a user interface macro form is specified
      in terms of calls to specified functions and generic functions
      which provide the actual behavior of the macro.  The arguments
      received by these functions and generic functions are derived in
      a specified way from the macro form.
    </P>

    <P>
      Converting a user interface macro form into the arguments to the
      appropriate functions and generic functions has two major
      aspects: the conversion of the macro argument syntax into a form
      more suitable for later processing, and the processing of macro
      arguments which are forms to be evaluated (including method
      bodies).
    </P>

    <P>
      In the syntax of the <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_defcla.htm#defclass">defclass</a> macro, the <I>initform</I>
      and <I>default-initarg-initial-value-form</I> arguments are
      forms which will be evaluated one or more times after the macro
      form is evaluated or executed.  Special processing must be done
      on these arguments to ensure that the lexical scope of the forms
      is captured properly.  This is done by building a function of
      zero arguments which, when called, returns the result of
      evaluating the form in the proper lexical environment.
    </P>

    <P>
      In the syntax of the <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_defmet.htm#defmethod">defmethod</a> macro the <I>form*</I>
      argument is a list of forms that comprise the body of the method
      definition.  This list of forms must be processed specially to
      capture the lexical scope of the macro form.  In addition, the
      lexical functions available only in the body of methods must be
      introduced.  To allow this and any other special processing
      (such as slot access optimization), a specializable protocol is
      used for processing the body of methods.  This is discussed in
      <a href="processing-method-bodies.html">
      the section ``Processing Method Bodies.''</a>
