<A NAME="ensure-class-using-class"><I>Generic Function</I> <B>ENSURE-CLASS-USING-CLASS</B>

<P><B>Syntax:</B></P>

<P><B>ensure-class-using-class</B>
  <I>class</I> <I>name</I> <TT>&amp;key</TT> 
  <TT>:direct-default-initargs</TT>
  <TT>:direct-slots</TT>
  <TT>:direct-superclasses</TT>
  <TT>:name</TT>
  <TT>:metaclass</TT>
  =&gt; <I>resulting-class</I></P>

<P><B>Arguments and values:</B></P>

<P><I>class</I> -- A class metaobject or <TT>NIL</TT>.</P>

<P><I>name</I> -- A class name.</P>

<P><TT>:metaclass</TT> -- A class metaobject class or a class
  metaobject class name. If this argument is not supplied, it defaults
  to the class named <TT>standard-class</TT>.  If a class name is
  supplied, it is interpreted as the class with that name.  If a class
  name is supplied, but there is no such class, an error is
  signaled.</P>

<P><TT>:direct-superclasses</TT> -- A list of which each element is a
class metaobject or a class name.  An error is signaled if this
argument is not a proper list.</P>

<P>
For the interpretation of additional keyword arguments,
see <a href="initialization-of-class-metaobjects.html"> Initialization
of Class Metaobjects</a>.</P>

<P><I>resulting-class</I> -- A class metaobject.</P>

<P><B>Description:</B></P>

<P>
This generic function is called to define or modify the definition of
a named class.  It is called by the <TT>ensure-class</TT> function.
It can also be called directly.
</P>

<P>
The first step performed by this generic function is to compute the
set of initialization arguments which will be used to create or
reinitialize the named class.  The initialization arguments are
computed from the full set of keyword arguments received by this
generic function as follows:
</P>

<UL>
  <LI> The <TT>:metaclass</TT> argument is not included in the
  initialization arguments.</LI>

  <LI> If the <TT>:direct-superclasses</TT> argument was received by
  this generic function, it is converted into a list of class
  metaobjects.  This conversion does not affect the structure of the
  supplied <TT>:direct-superclasses</TT> argument.  For each element in
  the <TT>:direct-superclasses</TT> argument:

    <UL>
      <LI>If the element is a class metaobject, that class metaobject
	is used.</LI>
      
      <LI>If the element names a class, that class metaobject is
	used.</LI>

      <LI>Otherwise an instance of the
	class <a href="class-forward-referenced-class.html">forward-referenced-class</a> is created and used.
	The proper name of the newly created forward referenced class
	metaobject is set to <I>name</I>.

    </UL>
  </LI>
  
  <LI>All other keyword arguments are included directly in the
    initialization arguments.</LI>

</UL>

<P>
If the <I>class</I> argument is <TT>nil</TT>, a new class metaobject is
created by calling the <TT>make-instance</TT> generic function with the
value of the <TT>:metaclass</TT> argument as its first argument, and the
previously computed initialization arguments.  The proper name of the
newly created class metaobject is set to <I>name</I>.  The newly
created class metaobject is returned.
</P>

<P>
If the <I>class</I> argument is a forward referenced
class, <TT>change-class</TT> is called to change its class to the value
specified by the <TT>:metaclass</TT> argument.  The class metaobject is
then reinitialized with the previously initialization arguments.
(This is a documented violation of the general constraint
that <TT>change-class</TT> not be used with class metaobjects.)
</P>

<P>
If the class of the <I>class</I> argument is not the same as the
class specified by the <TT>:metaclass</TT> argument, an error is signaled.
</P>

<P>
Otherwise, the class metaobject <I>class</I> is redefined by calling
the
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_reinit.htm#reinitialize-instance">
reinitialize-instance</a> generic function with <I>class</I>
and the initialization arguments.  The <I>class</I> argument is then
returned.
