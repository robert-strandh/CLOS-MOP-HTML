    <H3>The <TT>defmethod</TT> macro</H3>

The evaluation or execution of a <TT>defmethod</TT> form requires first that the
body of the method be converted to a method function.  This process is
described in the next section. The result of this process is a method function
and a set of additional initialization arguments to be used when creating the
new method.  Given these two values, the evaluation or execution of a <TT>defmethod</TT> form proceeds in three steps.

The first step ensures the existence of a generic function with the specified
name.  This is done by calling the function
<a href="ensure-generic-function.html">ensure-generic-function</a>.
The
first argument in this call is the generic function name specified in the <TT>defmethod</TT> form.

The second step is the creation of the new method metaobject by
calling
<a href="make-instance.html">make-instance</a>.
The class of the new method metaobject is determined by calling
<a href="generic-function-method-class.html">
generic-function-method-class</a> on the result of the call to
<a href="ensure-generic-function.html">ensure-generic-function</a>
from the first step.

The initialization arguments received by the call to
<a href="make-instance.html">make-instance</a>
are as follows:

<UL>

<LI>The value of the <TT>qualifiers</TT> initialization argument is a list
of the qualifiers which appeared in the <TT>defmethod</TT> form.  No special
processing is done on these values.  The order of the elements of this list is
the same as in the <TT>defmethod</TT> form.
</LI>

<LI> The value of the <TT>lambda-list</TT> initialization argument is the
unspecialized lambda list from the <TT>defmethod</TT> form.
</LI>

<LI>The value of the <TT>specializers</TT> initialization argument is a list
of the specializers for the method.  For specializers which are classes, the
specializer is the class metaobject itself.  In the case of <TT>eql</TT>
specializers, it will be an 
<a href="class-eql-specializer.html">eql-specializer</a> metaobject
obtained by calling
<a href="intern-eql-specializer.html">intern-eql-specializer</a>
on the result of
evaluating the <TT>eql</TT> specializer form in the lexical
environment of the <TT>defmethod</TT> form.
</LI>

<LI>The value of the <TT>function</TT> initialization argument is the method
function.
</LI>

<LI>The value of the <TT>declarations</TT> initialization argument is a
list of the declarations from the <TT>defmethod</TT> form.  If there are no
declarations in the macro form, this initialization argument either doesn't
appear, or appears with a value of the empty list.
</LI>

<LI>The value of the <TT>documentation</TT> initialization argument is the
documentation string from the <TT>defmethod</TT> form.  If there is no
documentation string in the macro form this initialization argument either
doesn't appear, or appears with a value of false.
</LI>

<LI>Any other initialization argument produced in conjunction with the method
function are also included.
</LI>

<LI>The implementation is free to include additional
initialization arguments provided these are not symbols accessible in the
<TT>common-lisp-user</TT> package, or exported by any package defined
in the ANSI Common Lisp standard.
</LI>

</UL>

In the third step, 
<a href="add-method.html">add-method</a> is called to add the newly
created method to the set of methods associated with the generic
function metaobject.

The result of the call to <a href="add-method.html">add-method</a> is
returned as the result of evaluating or executing
the <TT>defmethod</TT> form.

An example showing a typical <TT>defmethod</TT> form and a sample expansion is
shown in 
<a href="fig-defmethod-1.html">this figure</a>.
The processing of the method body for this
method is shown in
