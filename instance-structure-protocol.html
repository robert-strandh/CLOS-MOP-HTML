  <H3>Instance Structure Protocol</H3>

<p>
The instance structure protocol is responsible for implementing the behavior
of the slot access functions like
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_slt_va.htm#slot-value">slot-value</a>
and
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_slt_va.htm#slot-value">
(setf slot-value)</a>.
</p>

<p>
For each CLOS slot access function other than
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_slt_ex.htm#slot-exists-p">slot-exists-p</a>, there is a
corresponding generic function which actually provides the behavior of the
function.  When called, the slot access function finds the pertinent effective
slot definition metaobject, calls the corresponding generic function and
returns its result.  The arguments passed on to the generic function include
one additional value, the class of the <I>object</I> argument, which always
immediately precedes the <I>object</I> argument.
</p>

<p>
The correspondences between slot access function and underlying slot access
generic function are as follows:
</p>

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Slot access function</th>
    <th>Corresponding slot access generic function</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_slt_bo.htm#slot-boundp">slot-boundp</a>
    </td>

      <a href="slot-boundp-using-class.html">slot-boundp-using-class</a>

      <a href="slot-makunbound-using-class.html">slot-makunbound-using-class</a>

    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_slt_va.htm#slot-value">
	(setf slot-value)</a>
    </td>
    <td>
      <a href="setf-slot-value-using-class.html">(setf slot-value-using-class)</a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
At the lowest level, the instance structure protocol provides only limited
mechanisms for portable programs to control the implementation of instances
and to directly access the storage associated with instances without going
through the indirection of slot access.  This is done to allow portable
programs to perform certain commonly requested slot access optimizations.
</p>

<p>
In particular, portable programs can control the implementation of,
and obtain direct access to, slots with allocation <TT>:instance</TT>
and type <B>t</B>.  These are called <I>directly accessible slots</I>.
</p>

<p>
The relevant specified around-method on
<a href="compute-slots.html">compute-slots</a>
determines the
implementation of instances by deciding how each slot in the instance will be
stored.  For each directly accessible slot, this method allocates a
<I>location</I> and associates it with the effective slot definition metaobject.
The location can be accessed by calling the
<a href="slot-definition-location.html">slot-definition-location</a>
generic function.  Locations are non-negative integers.  For a given class,
the locations increase consecutively, in the order that the directly
accessible slots appear in the list of effective slots.  (Note that here, the
next paragraph, and the specification of this around-method are the only
places where the value returned by
<a href="compute-slots.html">compute-slots</a>
is described as a list rather than a set.)
</p>

<p>
Given the location of a directly accessible slot, the value of that slot in an
instance can be accessed with the appropriate accessor.  For 
<a href="standard-class.html">standard-class</a>, 
this accessor is the function
<a href="standard-instance-access.html">standard-instance-access</a>.
For
<a href="funcallable-standard-class.html">funcallable-standard-class</a>,
this accessor is the function
<a href="funcallable-standard-instance-access.html">
  funcallable-standard-instance-access</a>.
In each case, the arguments to the
accessor are the instance and the slot location, in that order.  See the
definition of each accessor for additional restrictions
on the use of these function.
</p>

<H4>Example:</H4>

<p>
The following example shows the use of this mechanism to implement a
new class metaobject class, <TT>ordered-class</TT> and class
option <TT>:slot-order</TT>.  This option provides control over the
allocation of slot locations.  In this simple example implementation,
the <TT>:slot-order</TT> option is not inherited by subclasses; it
controls only instances of the class itself.
</p>

<pre>
(defclass ordered-class (standard-class)
  ((slot-order :initform ()
               :initarg :slot-order
               :reader class-slot-order)))

(defmethod compute-slots ((class ordered-class))
  (let ((order (class-slot-order class)))
    (sort (copy-list (call-next-method))
          #'(lambda (a b)
              (< (position (slot-definition-name a) order)
                 (position (slot-definition-name b) order))))))
</pre>

<p>
Following is the source code the user of this extension would write.
 Note that because the code above doesn't implement inheritance of the
<TT>:slot-order</TT> option, the function <TT>distance</TT> must not
be called on instances of subclasses of <TT>point</TT>; it can only be
called on instances of <TT>point</TT> itself.
</p>

<pre>
(defclass point ()
     ((x :initform 0)
      (y :initform 0))
  (:metaclass ordered-class)
  (:slot-order x y))

(defun distance (point)
  (sqrt (/ (+ (expt (standard-instance-access point 0) 2)
              (expt (standard-instance-access point 1) 2))
           2.0)))
</pre>

<p>
In more realistic uses of this mechanism, the calls to the low-level
instance structure accessors would not actually appear textually in
the source program, but rather would be generated by a meta-level
analysis program run during the process of compiling the source
program.
