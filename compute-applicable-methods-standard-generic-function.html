<P><B>compute-applicable-methods</B> <I>(generic-function</I>
  standard-generic-function) <I>arguments</I> =&gt; <I>methods</I>

<P><B>Description:</B></P>

<p>
This method signals an error if any method of the generic function has
a specializer which is neither a class metaobject nor an <B>eql</B>
specializer metaobject.
</p>

<p>
Otherwise, this method computes the sorted list of applicable methods
according to the rules described in the section of the CLOS
Specification called 
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/clm/node283.html#SECTION003217000000000000000">
``Method Selection and Combination.''</a>
</p>

<p>
This method can be overridden.  Because of the consistency requirements
between this generic function and
<a href="compute-applicable-methods-using-classes.html">
compute-applicable-methods-using-classes</a>, doing so may require also
overriding
<a href="compute-applicable-methods-using-classes-standard-generic-function.html">
compute-applicable-methods-using-classes (standard-generic-function t)</a>.
