<H3>Initialization of Method Metaobjects</H3>

<P>
  A method metaobject can be created by calling 
  <a href="make-instance.html">
    make-instance</a>.  The
  initialization arguments establish the definition of the method.  
  A method
  metaobject cannot be redefined; calling 
  <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_reinit.htm#reinitialize-instance">
    reinitialize-instance</a> signals an error.
</P>

<P>
  Initialization of a method metaobject must be done by calling 
  <a href="make-instance.html">
    make-instance</a>
  and allowing it to call 
  <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_init_i.htm#initialize-instance">initialize-instance</a>.
  Portable programs must not call
  <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_init_i.htm#initialize-instance">initialize-instance</a>
  directly to initialize a method metaoject. Portable programs must not
  call
  <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_shared.htm#shared-initialize">shared-initialize</a>
  directly to initialize a method metaobject.  Portable programs must not
  call 
  <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_chg_cl.htm#change-class">change-class</a>
  to change the class of any method metaobject or to turn a non-method
  object into a method metaobject.
</P>

<P>
  Since metaobject classes may not be redefined, no behavior is specified for
  the result of calls to
  <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_upda_1.htm#update-instance-for-redefined-class">update-instance-for-redefined-class</a>
  on method metaobjects.  Since the class of a method metaobject
  cannot be changed, no behavior is specified for the result of calls
  to
  <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_update.htm#update-instance-for-different-class">update-instance-for-different-class</a>
  on method metaobjects.
</P>

<P>
  During initialization, each initialization argument is checked for
  errors and then associated with the method metaobject.  The value
  can then be accessed by calling the appropriate accessor as shown in
  the table below (FIXME: insert anchor reference).
</P>

<P>
  This section begins with a description of the error checking and
  processing of each initialization argument.  This is followed by a
  table showing the generic functions that can be used to access the
  stored initialization arguments.  The section ends with a set of
  restrictions on portable methods affecting method metaobject
  initialization.
</P>

<P>
  In these descriptions, the phrase ``this argument defaults
  to <I>value</I>'' means that when that initialization argument is
  not supplied, initialization or reinitialization is performed as
  if <I>value</I> had been supplied.  For some initialization
  arguments this could be done by the use of default initialization
  arguments, but whether it is done this way is not specified.
  Implementations are free to define default initialization arguments
  for specified method metaobject classes.  Portable programs are free
  to define default initialization arguments for portable subclasses
  of the class
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/t_method.htm#method">
method</a>.
</P>

<UL>
  
  <LI><P>The <TT>:qualifiers</TT> argument is a list of method
      qualifiers.  An error is signaled if this value is not a proper
      list, or if any element of the list is not a non-null atom. This
      argument defaults to the empty list.
  </P></LI>

  <LI><P>The <TT>:lambda-list</TT> argument is the unspecialized
      lambda list of the method.  An error is signaled if this value
      is not a proper lambda list. If this value is not supplied, an
      error is signaled.
  </P></LI>

  <LI><P>The <TT>:specializers</TT> argument is a list of the
      specializer metaobjects for the method.  An error is signaled if
      this value is not a proper list, or if the length of the list
      differs from the number of required arguments in
      the <TT>:lambda-list</TT> argument, or if any element of the
      list is not a specializer metaobject.  If this value is not
      supplied, an error is signaled.
      </P></LI>

  <LI><P>The <TT>:function</TT> argument is a method function.  It must be
      compatible with the methods on
      <a href="compute-effective-method.html">compute-effective-method</a>
      defined for this class of method and generic function with which it
      will be used.  That is, it must accept the same number of arguments as
      all uses of 
      <a href="https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_call_m.htm#call-method">call-method</a> that will call it
      supply.  (See
      <a href="compute-effective-method.html">compute-effective-method</a>
      for more information.)  An error is signaled if this argument is not
      supplied.
      </P></LI>

  <LI><P>When the method being initialized is an instance of a subclass of
      <TT>standard-accessor-method</TT>, the <TT>:slot-definition</TT>
      initialization argument must be provided.  Its value is the
      direct slot definition metaobject which defines this accessor
      method.  An error is signaled if the value is not an instance of
      a subclass of
      <TT>direct-slot-definition</TT>.
      </P></LI>

  <LI><P> The <TT>:documentation</TT> argument is a string
      or <TT>nil</TT>.  An error is signaled if this value is not a
      string or <TT>nil</TT>.  This argument defaults to <TT>nil</TT>.
      </P></LI>
</UL>

<P>
  After the processing and defaulting of initialization arguments
  described above, the value of each initialization argument is
  associated with the method metaobject.  These values can then be
  accessed by calling the corresponding generic function.  The
  correspondences are as follows:

<H2>Methods</H2>

<P>
  It is not specified which methods provide the initialization
  behavior described above.  Instead, the information needed to allow
  portable programs to specialize this behavior is presented in as a
  set of restrictions on the methods a portable program can define.
  The model is that portable initialization methods have access to the
  method metaobject when either all or none of the specified
  initialization has taken effect.
</P>

<P>
  These restrictions govern the methods that a portable program can
  define on the generic functions 
  <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_init_i.htm#initialize-instance">initialize-instance</a>
  <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_reinit.htm#reinitialize-instance">
    reinitialize-instance</a>, and 
  <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_shared.htm#shared-initialize">shared-initialize</a>.
  These restrictions apply only to methods on these generic functions
  for which the first specializer is a subclass of the class 
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/t_method.htm#method">
method</a>.  Other portable methods on these generic functions are not
  affected by these restrictions.

	  run, all of the initialization behavior described above has

The results are undefined if any of these restrictions are violated.
