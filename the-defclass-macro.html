    <H3>The <TT>defclass</TT> macro</H3>

    <P>
      The evaluation or execution of a <TT>defclass</TT> form results
      in a call to the
      <a href="ensure-class.html">ensure-class</a> function. The
      arguments received by <a href="ensure-class.html">ensure-class</a> are derived from the
      <TT>defclass</TT> form in a defined way.  The exact macro-expansion
      of the <TT>defclass</TT> form is not defined, only the relationship
      between the arguments to the <TT>defclass</TT> macro and the
      arguments received by the <a href="ensure-class.html">ensure-class</a> function.  Examples
      of typical <TT>defclass</TT> forms and sample expansions are shown
      in the Figures below.

    <P>
      A <TT>defclass</TT> form with non-standard class and slot options, and an
      expansion of it which results in the proper call to
      <a href="ensure-class.html">ensure-class</a>.  Note that the
      order of the slot options has not affected the order of the
      properties in the canonicalized slot specification, but has
      affected the order of the elements in the lists which are the
      values of those properties.

	  The <I>name</I> argument to <TT>defclass</TT> becomes the

	  the only positional argument accepted
	  by <a href="ensure-class.html">ensure-class</a>; all other

	  The <I>direct slots</I> argument to <TT>defclass</TT>
	  becomes the value of the <TT>:direct-slots</TT> keyword
	  argument to <a href="ensure-class.html">ensure-class</a>.
	  Special processing of this value is done to regularize the
	  form of each slot specification and to properly capture the
	  lexical scope of the initialization forms.  This is done by
	  converting each slot specification to a property list called
	  a <I>canonicalized slot specification</I>.  The resulting
	  list of canonicalized slot specifications is the value of
	  the <TT>:direct-slots</TT> keyword argument.

	<P>
	  Canonicalized slot specifications are later used as the keyword arguments to a
	  generic function which will, in turn, pass them to
	  <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_mk_ins.htm#make-instance">make-instance</a>
	  for use as a set of initialization arguments. Each

	    slot specification, then both the <TT>:initform</TT>
	    and <TT>:initfunction</TT> properties are present in the
	    canonicalized slot specification.  The value of
	    the <TT>:initform</TT> property is the initialization
	    form.  The value of the
	    <TT>:initfunction</TT> property is a function of zero arguments which, when
	    called, returns the result of evaluating the initialization form in its proper
	    lexical environment.

	  <P>
	    If the <TT>:initform</TT> slot option is not present in
	    the slot specification, then either
	    the <TT>:initfunction</TT> property will not appear, or

	    The value of the <TT>:readers</TT> property is a list of

	    The value of the <TT>:writers</TT> property is a list of
	    the values specified by each <TT>:writer</TT>
	    and <TT>:accessor</TT> slot option.  The value specified
	    by a <TT>:writer</TT> slot option is just the value of the
	    slot option.  The value specified by an <TT>:accessor</TT>
	    slot option is a two element list: the first element is
	    the symbol <TT>setf</TT>, the second element is the value
	    of the slot option.  If there are no

	    The value of the <TT>:documentation</TT> property is the value of the

	    All other slot options appear as the values of properties
	    with the same name as the slot option.  Note that this
	    includes not only the remaining standard slot options
	    (<TT>:allocation</TT> and <TT>:type</TT>), but also any
	    other options and values appearing in the slot
	    specification.  If one of these slot options appears more
	    than once, the value of the property will be a list of the
	    specified values.

	    An implementation is free to add additional properties to

	  The <I>default initargs</I> class option, if it is present in

	  to <a href="ensure-class.html">ensure-class</a>.  Special
	  processing of this value is done to properly capture the
	  lexical scope of the default value forms.  This is done by
	  converting each default initarg in the class option into
	  a <I>canonicalized default initarg</I>.  The resulting list
	  of canonicalized default initargs is the value of

	  <a href="ensure-class.html">ensure-class</a>.
	</P>

	<P>
	  A canonicalized default initarg is a list of three elements.
	  The first element is the name; the second is the actual form
	  itself; and the third is a function of zero arguments which,

	  value form in its proper lexical environment.

	  Any other class options become the value of keyword

    <P>
      In the call to <a href="ensure-class.html">ensure-class</a>,
      every element of its arguments appears in the same left-to-right
      order as the corresponding element of the <TT>defclass</TT>
      form, except that the order of the properties of canonicalized
      slot specifications is unspecified.  The values of properties in
      canonicalized slot specifications do follow this ordering
      requirement.  Other ordering relationships in the keyword
      arguments to
      <a href="ensure-class.html">ensure-class</a> are unspecified.

      The result of the call
