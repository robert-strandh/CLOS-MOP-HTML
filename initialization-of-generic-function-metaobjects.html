<H3>Initialization of Generic Function Metaobjects</H3>


<p>
A generic function metaobject can be created by
calling <a href="make-instance.html">
make-instance</a>.  The initialization arguments establish the
definition of the generic function.  A generic function metaobject can
be redefined by
calling <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_reinit.htm#reinitialize-instance">
reinitialize-instance</a>.
Some classes of generic function metaobject do not support
redefinition; in these
cases, <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_reinit.htm#reinitialize-instance">
reinitialize-instance</a>
signals an error.
</p>

<p>
Initialization of a generic function metaobject must be done by
calling <a href="make-instance.html">make-instance</a> and allowing it
to call <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_init_i.htm#initialize-instance">initialize-instance</a>.
Reinitialization of a generic-function metaobject must be done by
calling <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_reinit.htm#reinitialize-instance">
reinitialize-instance</a>.
Portable programs must not
call <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_init_i.htm#initialize-instance">initialize-instance</a>
directly to initialize a generic function metaobject.  Portable
programs must not
call <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_shared.htm#shared-initialize">shared-initialize</a> directly
to initialize or reinitialize a generic function metaobject.  Portable
programs must not
call <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_chg_cl.htm#change-class">
change-class</a> to change the class of any generic function
metaobject or to turn a non-generic-function object into a generic
function metaobject.
</p>

<p>
Since metaobject classes may not be redefined, no behavior is
specified for the result of calls
to <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_upda_1.htm#update-instance-for-redefined-class">update-instance-for-redefined-class</a>
on generic function metaobjects.  Since the class of a generic
function metaobject may not be changed, no behavior is specified for
the results of calls
to <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_update.htm#update-instance-for-different-class">update-instance-for-different-class</a>
on generic function metaobjects.
</p>

<p>
During initialization or reinitialization, each initialization
argument is checked for errors and then associated with the generic
function metaobject.  The value can then be accessed by calling the
appropriate accessor as shown in the table below. (FIXME:insert anchor).
</p>

<p>
This section begins with a description of the error checking and
processing of each initialization argument.  This is followed by a
table showing the generic functions that can be used to access the
stored initialization arguments. The section ends with a set of
restrictions on portable methods affecting generic function metaobject
initialization and reinitialization.
</p>

<p>
In these descriptions, the phrase ``this argument defaults to <I>value</I>''
means that when that initialization argument is not supplied, initialization
or reinitialization is performed as if <I>value</I> had been supplied.  For
some initialization arguments this could be done by the use of default
initialization arguments, but whether it is done this way is not specified.
Implementations are free to define default initialization arguments for
specified generic function metaobject classes.  Portable programs are free
to define default initialization arguments for portable subclasses of the
class <a href="generic-function.html">generic-function</a>.
</p>

<p>
Unless there is a specific note to the contrary, then during reinitialization,
if an initialization argument is not supplied, the previously stored value is
left unchanged.
</p>

<UL>
<LI>
<p>
The <TT>:argument-precedence-order</TT> argument is a list of symbols.
</p>

<p>
An error is signaled if this argument appears but
the <TT>:lambda-list</TT> argument does not appear.  An error is
signaled if this value is not a proper list or if this value is not a
permutation of the symbols from the required arguments part of
the <TT>:lambda-list</TT> initialization argument.
</p>

<p>
When the generic function is being initialized or reinitialized, and this
argument is not supplied, but the <TT>:lambda-list</TT> argument is supplied,
this value defaults to the symbols from the required arguments part of the
<TT>:lambda-list</TT> argument, in the order they appear in that argument.  If
neither argument is supplied, neither are initialized (see the description of
<TT>:lambda-list</TT>.)
</p>

<LI>
<p>
The <TT>:declarations</TT> argument is a list of declarations.
</p>

<p>
An error is signaled if this value is not a proper list or if each of its
elements is not a legal declaration.
</p>

<p>
When the generic function is being initialized, and this argument is not
supplied, it defaults to the empty list.
</p>
</LI>

<LI>
<p>
The <TT>:documentation</TT> argument is a string or <TT>nil</TT>.
</p>

<p>
An error is signaled if this value is not a string or <TT>nil</TT>.
</p>

<p>
If the generic function is being initialized, this argument defaults to <TT>nil</TT>.
</p>
</LI>

<LI>
<p>
The <TT>:lambda-list</TT> argument is a lambda list.
</p>

<p>
An error is signaled if this value is not a proper generic function lambda
list.
</p>

<p>
When the generic function is being initialized, and this argument is not
supplied, the generic function's lambda list is not initialized.  The
lambda list will be initialized later, either when the first method is
added to the generic function, or a later reinitialization of the
generic function.
</p>
</LI>

<LI>The <TT>:method-combination</TT> argument is a method combination
metaobject.
</LI>

<LI>
<p>
The <TT>:method-class</TT> argument is a class metaobject.
</p>

<p>
An error is signaled if this value is not a subclass of the class <a href="method.html">method</a>.
</p>

<p>
When the generic function is being initialized, and this argument is not
supplied, it defaults to the class <a href="standard-method.html">standard-method</a>.
</p>
</LI>

<LI>
<p>
The <TT>:name</TT> argument is an object.
</p>

<p>
If the generic function is being initialized, this argument defaults to <TT>nil</TT>.
</p>
</LI>
</UL>

<p>
After the processing and defaulting of initialization arguments described
above, the value of each initialization argument is associated with the
generic function metaobject.  These values can then be accessed by calling the
corresponding generic function.  The correspondences are as follows:

<H2>Methods</H2>

<p>
It is not specified which methods provide the initialization and
reinitialization behavior described above.  Instead, the information
needed to allow portable programs to specialize this behavior is
presented as a set of restrictions on the methods a portable program
can define.  The model is that portable initialization methods have
access to the generic function metaobject when either all or none of
the specified initialization has taken effect.
</p>

<p>
These restrictions govern the methods that a portable program can
define on the generic
functions <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_init_i.htm#initialize-instance">initialize-instance</a>,
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_reinit.htm#reinitialize-instance">
reinitialize-instance</a>,
and <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_shared.htm#shared-initialize">
shared-initialize</a>.  These
restrictions apply only to methods on these generic functions for
which the first specializer is a subclass of the
class <a href="generic-function.html">generic-function</a>.  Other
portable methods on these generic functions are not affected by these
restrictions.

<UL>

<LI>Portable programs must not define primary methods.</LI>

<LI>Portable programs may define around-methods, but these must be
extending, not overriding methods.</LI>

<LI> Portable before-methods must assume that when they are run, none
of the initialization behavior described above has been completed.</LI>

<LI>Portable after-methods must assume that when they are run, all of
the initialization behavior described above has been completed.</LI>

</UL>

<p>
The results are undefined if any of these restrictions are violated.
