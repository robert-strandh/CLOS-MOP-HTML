<A NAME="compute-discriminating-function"><I>Generic Function</I> <B>COMPUTE-DISCRIMINATING-FUNCTION</B>

<P><B>Syntax:</B></P>

<P><B>compute-discriminating-function</B> <I>generic-function</I> =&gt; 
<I>function</I>

<P><B>Arguments and values:</B></P>

<P><I>generic-function</I> -- A generic function metaobject.</P>

<P><I>function</I> -- A function. 

<P><B>Description:</B></P>

<p>
This generic function is called to determine the discriminating
function for a generic function.  When a generic function is called,
the <I>installed</I> discriminating function is called with the full
set of arguments received by the generic function, and must implement
the behavior of calling the generic function: determining the ordered
set of applicable methods, determining the effective method, and
running the effective method.
</p>

<p>
To determine the ordered set of applicable methods, the discriminating
function first calls 
<a href="compute-applicable-methods-using-classes.html">
compute-applicable-methods-using-classes</a>.  If
<a href="compute-applicable-methods-using-classes.html">
compute-applicable-methods-using-classes</a> returns a second value of
false, the discriminating function then calls
<a href="compute-applicable-methods.html">
compute-applicable-methods</a>.
</p>

<p>
When 
<a href="compute-applicable-methods-using-classes.html">
compute-applicable-methods-using-classes</a>
returns a second value of
true, the discriminating function is permitted to memoize the first returned
value as follows.  The discriminating function may reuse the list of
applicable methods without calling 
<a href="compute-applicable-methods-using-classes.html">
compute-applicable-methods-using-classes</a>
again provided that:
</p>

<ol type="i">
<li> the generic function is being called again with required arguments
which are instances of the same classes,</li>

<li> the generic function has not been reinitialized,</li>

<li> no method has been added to or removed from the generic function,</li>

<li> for all the specializers of all the generic function's methods
which are classes, their class precedence lists have not changed and</li>

<li> for any such memoized value, the class precedence list of the class
of each of the required arguments has not changed.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Determination of the effective method is done by calling
<a href="compute-effective-method.html">compute-effective-method</a>
When the effective method is run, each method's
function is called, and receives as arguments: (i) a list of the arguments to
the generic function, and (ii) whatever other arguments are specified in the
<a href="call-method.html">call-method</a>
form indicating that the method should be called.  (See 
<a href="make-method-lambda.html">make-method-lambda</a> for more
information about how method functions are called.)
</p>

<p>
The generic function 
<a href="compute-discriminating-function.html">compute-discriminating-function</a> 
is called, and its
result installed, by 
<a href="add-method.html">add-method</a>,
<a href="remove-method.html">remove-method</a>,
<a href="initialize-instance.html">initialize-instance</a>, and
<a href="reinitialize-instance.html">reinitialize-instance</a>.

<P><B>Remarks:</B></P>

  <P>
    Since client code is not allowed to define methods
    on <tt>compute-applicable-methods</tt> specialized
    to <tt>standard-generic-function</tt>, it can be argued that
    for <tt>standard-generic-function</tt>, <tt>compute-applicable-methods</tt>
    does not have to be called.  By relaxing the description
    of <tt>compute-discriminating-function</tt> this way, the
    implementation may also cache results
    when <tt>compute-applicable-methods-using-classes</tt>
    returns <tt>nil</tt> in its second argument.  More generally,
    whenever some behavior is defined for generic functions when called
    with only standard classes, since client code is not allowed to
    alter this behavior in any way, the implementation is often free
    to choose whatever appropriate implementation technique that has
    the same affect as the one specified.  Notice, however, that any
    behavior that diverges from what is specified, must not be
    inherited by client-defined subclasses.  Only when arguments are
    direct instances of specified classes can the implementation
    arbitrarily choose some other technique. -- Robert Strandh 2017-01-23.

  <P>
    This page seems to suggest that <tt>compute-effective-method</tt>
    needs to be called by the discriminating function each time the
    generic function is invoked.  It would still be possible to avoid
    such calls for standard generic functions by the same rule as in
    the previous remark.  But invoking a non-standard generic function
    would be too slow then.  And page 126 in the AMOP book suggests
    that the result of
    calling <tt>compute-effective-method-function</tt> (a function
    that does not exist in the specification, and was replaced
    by <tt>compute-effective-method</tt>) could be cached.  It would
    seem reasonable, then, for an implementation to be allowed to
    cache the result of calling <tt>compute-effective-method</tt>
    whenever it is allowed to cache the result of
    calling <tt>compute-applicable-methods-using-classes</tt>.
