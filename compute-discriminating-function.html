<P><B>Syntax:</B></P>

<P><B>compute-discriminating-function</B> <I>generic-function</I> =&gt; 
<I>function</I>

<P><B>Arguments and values:</B></P>

<P><I>generic-function</I> -- A generic function metaobject.</P>

<P><I>function</I> -- A function. 

<P><B>Description:</B></P>

<p>
This generic function is called to determine the discriminating
function for a generic function.  When a generic function is called,
the <I>installed</I> discriminating function is called with the full
set of arguments received by the generic function, and must implement
the behavior of calling the generic function: determining the ordered
set of applicable methods, determining the effective method, and
running the effective method.
</p>

<p>
To determine the ordered set of applicable methods, the discriminating
function first calls 
<a href="compute-applicable-methods-using-classes.html">
compute-applicable-methods-using-classes</a>.  If
<a href="compute-applicable-methods-using-classes.html">
compute-applicable-methods-using-classes</a> returns a second value of
false, the discriminating function then calls
<a href="compute-applicable-methods.html">
compute-applicable-methods</a>.
</p>

<p>
When 
<a href="compute-applicable-methods-using-classes.html">
compute-applicable-methods-using-classes</a>
returns a second value of
true, the discriminating function is permitted to memoize the first returned
value as follows.  The discriminating function may reuse the list of
applicable methods without calling 
<a href="compute-applicable-methods-using-classes.html">
compute-applicable-methods-using-classes</a>
again provided that:
</p>

<ol type="i">
<li> the generic function is being called again with required arguments
which are instances of the same classes,</li>

<li> the generic function has not been reinitialized,</li>

<li> no method has been added to or removed from the generic function,</li>

<li> for all the specializers of all the generic function's methods
which are classes, their class precedence lists have not changed and</li>

<li> for any such memoized value, the class precedence list of the class
of each of the required arguments has not changed.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Determination of the effective method is done by calling
<a href="compute-effective-method.html">compute-effective-method</a>
When the effective method is run, each method's
function is called, and receives as arguments: (i) a list of the arguments to
the generic function, and (ii) whatever other arguments are specified in the
<a href="call-method.html">call-method</a>
form indicating that the method should be called.  (See 
<a href="make-method-lambda.html">make-method-lambda</a> for more
information about how method functions are called.)
</p>

<p>
The generic function 
<a href="compute-discriminating-function.html">compute-discriminating-function</a> 
is called, and its
result installed, by 
<a href="add-method.html">add-method</a>,
<a href="remove-method.html">remove-method</a>,
<a href="initialize-instance.html">initialize-instance</a>, and
<a href="reinitialize-instance.html">reinitialize-instance</a>.
