<P><B>Syntax:</B></P>

<P><B>compute-applicable-methods-using-classes</B> <I>(generic-function</I>
  standard-generic-function) <I>classes</I> =&gt; <I>methods</I>, <I>ok</I>

<P><B>Description:</B></P>

<p>
If any method of the generic function has a specializer which is
neither a class metaobject nor an <B>eql</B> specializer metaobject,
this method signals an error.
</p>

<p>
In cases where the generic function has no methods with <B>eql</B>
specializers, or has no methods with <B>eql</B> specializers that
could be applicable to arguments of the supplied classes, this method
returns the ordered list of applicable methods as its first value and
true as its second value.
</p>

<p>
Otherwise this method returns an unspecified first value and false as
its second value.
</p>

<p>
This method can be overridden. Because of the consistency requirements
between this generic function and 
<a href="compute-applicable-methods.html">compute-applicable-methods</a> 
doing so may require also overriding
<a href="compute-applicable-methods-standard-generic-function.html">
compute-applicable-methods (standard-generic-function t)</a>
